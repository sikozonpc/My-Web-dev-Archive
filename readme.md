# Archive Introduction

> On my journey I've stored files with information that I might wanted to read in a near future, but it wasnt organized. Then, after some time I decided to write this archive **with the stuff and resources I learnt along the way with its respective sources**.
<br>

Note that this is not accurate since I can't remember all the sources of information and they are very scattered on the Internet.
<br>

The purpose of this archive is to store the most important sources of information for quick and later access.
<br>

And its open to everyone to read and follow (if you are just starting out).
